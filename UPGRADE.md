# Upgrade Guide

## Migrating from Laravel Mix to Vite

> **Note:** This upgrade guide does not cover all possible Mix use cases, such as Sass compilation. Please consult the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for information on configuring Vite for these scenarios.

### Install Vite and the Laravel Plugin

First, you will need to install [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the [Laravel Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-vite-plugin) using your npm package manager of choice:

```shell
npm install --save-dev vite laravel-vite-plugin
```

You may also need to install additional Vite plugins for your project, such as the Vue or React plugins:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-vue
```

```shell
npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react
```

### Configure Vite

Create a `vite.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
// import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
// import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel([
            'resources/css/app.css',
            'resources/js/app.js',
        ]),
        // react(),
        // vue({
        //     template: {
        //         transformAssetUrls: {
        //             base: null,
        //             includeAbsolute: false,
        //         },
        //     },
        // }),
    ],
});
```

If you are building an SPA, you will get a better developer experience by removing the CSS entry point above and [importing your CSS from Javascript](#importing-your-css-from-your-javascript-entry-points).

#### Update Aliases

If you are migrating aliases from your `webpack.mix.js` file to your `vite.config.js` file, you should ensure that the paths start with `/`. For example, `resources/js` would become `/resources/js`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel([
            'resources/css/app.css',
            'resources/js/app.js',
        ]),
    ],
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            '@': '/resources/js'
        }
    }
});
```

For your convenience, the Laravel Vite plugin automatically adds an `@` alias for your `/resources/js` directory. If you do not need to customize your aliases, you may omit this section from your `vite.config.js` file.

### Update NPM scripts

Update your NPM scripts in `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-     "dev": "npm run development",
-     "development": "mix",
-     "watch": "mix watch",
-     "watch-poll": "mix watch -- --watch-options-poll=1000",
-     "hot": "mix watch --hot",
-     "prod": "npm run production",
-     "production": "mix --production"
+     "dev": "vite",
+     "build": "vite build"
  }
```

### Vite compatible imports

Vite only supports ES modules, so if you are upgrading an existing application you will need to replace any `require()` statements with `import`. You may refer to [this pull request](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/5895/files) for an example.

#### Inertia

Inertia makes use of a `require()` call that is more complex to replicate with Vite.

The following function can be used instead:

```diff
+ import { resolvePageComponent } from 'laravel-vite-plugin/inertia-helpers';

  createInertiaApp({
      title: (title) => `${title} - ${appName}`,
-     resolve: (name) => require(`./Pages/${name}.vue`),
+     resolve: (name) => resolvePageComponent(`./Pages/${name}.vue`, import.meta.glob('./Pages/**/*.vue')),
      setup({ el, app, props, plugin }) {
          return createApp({ render: () => h(app, props) })
              .use(plugin)
              .mixin({ methods: { route } })
              .mount(el);
      },
  });
```

### Update environment variables

You will need to update the environment variables that are explicitly exposed in your `.env` files and in hosting environments such as Forge to use the `VITE_` prefix instead of `MIX_`:

```diff
- MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
- MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
+ VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
+ VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```

> **Note:** You may optionally maintain the `MIX_` prefix by [configuring Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/#envprefix) to use it.

You will also need to update these references in your JavaScript code to use the new variable name and Vite syntax:

```diff
-    key: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
-    cluster: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
+    key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
+    cluster: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
```

### Importing your CSS from your JavaScript entry point(s)

If you are building an SPA, you will get a better experience by importing your CSS from your JavaScript entry point(s), such as your `resources/js/app.js` entry point:

```diff
  import './bootstrap';
+ import '../css/app.css';
```

In development mode, Vite will automatically inject your CSS into the page. In production, a dedicated stylesheet will be generated that the `@vite` directive will load from the manifest.

### Replace `mix()` with `@vite`

When using Vite, you will need to use the `@vite` Blade directive instead of the `mix()` helper.

This will automatically detect whether you are running in serve or build mode and include all of the required `<script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` for you:

```diff
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ mix('css/app.css') }}">
- <script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
+ @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

The entry points should match those used in your `vite.config.js`.

#### React

If you are using React and hot-module replacement, you will need to include an additional directive *before* the `@vite` directive:

```html
@viteReactRefresh
@vite('resources/js/app.jsx')
```

This loads a React "refresh runtime" in development mode only, which is required for hot module replacement to work correctly.

### JavaScript files containing JSX must use a `.jsx` extension

You will need to rename any `.js` files containing JSX to instead have a `.jsx` extension. If you need to rename your entry point then you should read the [entry point docs](https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin/blob/docs/docs/vite.md#entry-points) to learn how to configure the Laravel plugin for your project.

See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1362050255009816577) from Vite's creator for more information.

> **Note:** If you are using Tailwind, remember to update the paths in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Vue imports must include the `.vue` extension

```diff
- import Button from './Button';
+ import Button from './Button.vue';
```

### Remove Laravel Mix

The Laravel Mix package can now be uninstalled:

```shell
npm remove laravel-mix
```

And you may remove your Mix configuration file:

```shell
rm webpack.mix.js
```

If you are using StyleCI and have ignored the `webpack.mix.js` file in your configuration, you may also wish to remove the ignore rule.

### Update Test Helpers

If you are using the `$this->withoutMix();` helper in your tests, you should replace this with `$this->withoutVite()`:

```diff
- $this->withoutMix();
+ $this->withoutVite();
```

### Optional: Configure Tailwind

If you are using Tailwind, perhaps with one of Laravel's starter kits, you will need to create a `postcss.config.js` file. Tailwind can generate this for you automatically:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Or, you can create it manually:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

If you are using other PostCSS plugins, such as `postcss-import`, you will need to include them in your configuration.

### Optional: Git ignore the build directory

Vite will place all of your build assets into a `build` subdirectory inside your public directory. If you prefer to build your assets on deploy instead of committing them to your repository, you may wish to add this directory to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
/public/build
```

### Optional: Update SSR configuration

You may remove your dedicated Laravel Mix SSR configuration:

```shell
rm webpack.ssr.mix.js
```

In most cases, you won't need a dedicated SSR configuration file when using Vite. You can specify your SSR entry point by passing a configuration option to the Laravel plugin:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: 'resources/js/app.js',
            ssr: 'resources/js/ssr.js',
        }),
    ],
});
```

You may wish to add the following additional scripts to your `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",
-     "build": "vite build"
+     "build": "vite build && vite build --ssr"
  }
```

If you prefer to build your assets on deploy instead of committing them to your repository, you may wish to add the SSR output directory to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
/storage/ssr
```

You may start the SSR server using `node`:

```sh
node storage/ssr/ssr.js
```

### Wrapping up

You should now be able to build your assets using `dev` command. This will also invoke the Vite server and Vite will watch for file changes:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, if you need to build files without watching or if you need to build them for production, you may use the `build` command:

```shell
npm run build
```

For further information on how to use Vite, please check out [the Laravel Vite documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/vite).

## Migrating from Vite to Laravel Mix

### Install Laravel Mix

First, you will need to install Laravel Mix using your npm package manager of choice:

```shell
npm install --save-dev laravel-mix
```

### Configure Mix

Create a `webpack.mix.js` file in the root of your project:

```
const mix = require('laravel-mix');

/*
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Mix Asset Management
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | Mix provides a clean, fluent API for defining some Webpack build steps
 | for your Laravel applications. By default, we are compiling the CSS
 | file for the application as well as bundling up all the JS files.
 |
 */

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .postCss('resources/css/app.css', 'public/css', [
        //
    ]);
```

### Update NPM scripts

Update your NPM scripts in `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-     "dev": "vite",
-     "build": "vite build"
+     "dev": "npm run development",
+     "development": "mix",
+     "watch": "mix watch",
+     "watch-poll": "mix watch -- --watch-options-poll=1000",
+     "hot": "mix watch --hot",
+     "prod": "npm run production",
+     "production": "mix --production"
  }
```

#### Inertia

Vite requires a helper function to import page components which is not required with Laravel Mix. You can remove this as follows:

```diff
- import { resolvePageComponent } from 'laravel-vite-plugin/inertia-helpers';

  createInertiaApp({
      title: (title) => `${title} - ${appName}`,
-     resolve: (name) => resolvePageComponent(`./Pages/${name}.vue`, import.meta.glob('./Pages/**/*.vue')),
+     resolve: (name) => require(`./Pages/${name}.vue`),
      setup({ el, app, props, plugin }) {
          return createApp({ render: () => h(app, props) })
              .use(plugin)
              .mixin({ methods: { route } })
              .mount(el);
      },
  });
```

### Update environment variables

You will need to update the environment variables that are explicitly exposed in your `.env` files and in hosting environments such as Forge to use the `MIX_` prefix instead of `VITE_`:

```diff
- VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
- VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
+ MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
+ MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```

You will also need to update these references in your JavaScript code to use the new variable name and Node syntax:

```diff
-    key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
-    cluster: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
+    key: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
+    cluster: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
```

### Remove CSS imports from your JavaScript entry point(s)

If you are importing your CSS via JavaScript, you will need to remove these statements:

```js
- import '../css/app.css';
```

### Replace `@vite` with `mix()`

You will need to replace the `@vite` Blade directive with `<script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags and the `mix()` helper:

```diff
- @viteReactRefresh
- @vite('resources/js/app.js')
+ <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ mix('css/app.css') }}">
+ <script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
```

### Remove Vite and the Laravel Plugin

Vite and the Laravel Plugin can now be uninstalled:

```shell
npm remove vite laravel-vite-plugin
```

Next, you may remove your Vite configuration file:

```shell
rm vite.config.js
```

You may also wish to remove any `.gitignore` paths you are no longer using:

```gitignore
- /public/build
- /storage/ssr
```
